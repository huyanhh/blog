## Reflections

React Native is really cool, styling it is super easy and hot loading makes my
life pretty good.

## Challenges

I still don't really understand how to make "nooks and crannies,"; hoping I'll
pick it up soon.

I'm still sleeping pretty late, but as long as I accomplish all my goals, I'll
go to bed a lot happier.

Getting a blog out is a lot of work.
